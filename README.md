# 🚗 ControlCar

## 🚀 Overview

**ControlCar** is a B2B multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to modernize and optimize the management of automotive repair shops and mechanical workshops.

Built from the ground up with a strong focus on scalability, security, tenant isolation, and operational efficiency, the platform centralizes the core business workflow — from customer and vehicle registration to service order (Work Order) management, subscription control, and administrative provisioning.

The system follows a hybrid and containerized architecture that clearly separates responsibilities between the frontend experience and backend business logic, ensuring maintainability, reproducibility, and production-ready deployment.

ControlCar was also developed with a strong software engineering foundation, combining traditional requirements engineering with agile product execution using Scrum.

## 🔒 Multi-Tenant Architecture

One of the most critical aspects of ControlCar is its **tenant isolation strategy**.

Each workshop operates as an isolated tenant using:

* Subdomain-based tenant routing
* Logical tenant separation
* Dedicated provisioning flow
* Subscription-aware access control

This ensures that Workshop A can never access Workshop B’s operational data — a critical requirement for SaaS compliance, security, and trust.

This architecture enables safe horizontal scaling while preserving centralized administration through the Control Plane.

---

## 🗄️ Database Management

ControlCar uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary relational database.

Features include:

* Versioned schema migrations
* Tenant-aware persistence strategy
* Initialization scripts for reproducible environments
* Administrative inspection through pgAdmin

Database setup is supported by:

```text
db/init.sql
db/schema.sql
```

---

## ⚙️ Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/controlcar.git
cd controlcar
```

---

## 2. Start containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command provisions:

* PostgreSQL database
* pgAdmin
* Django backend API
* Next.js frontend application

All services run inside an isolated Docker bridge network.

---

## 3. Access the application

Frontend:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Backend API:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

pgAdmin:

```text
http://localhost:5050
```
